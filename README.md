Currently working on making this profile look good!

Hey, I'm Carnoraptor - I love all things computer science, but my passions lie specifically in game development and theory. 

I've yet to publish much on here, but my Itch.io page (https://carnoraptor.itch.io/) features two games I've made for game jams! Both are fairly amateurish (neither was made with much experience - I like Deconstruction but it's code is horrendous and Armchair Detective is... not a good game), but I've yet to add more to the page due to my shift in focus. I feel like as I come up on my third year of Unity experience, and my first year of time I've been fully working on it (I took an extended break from early 2021 to late 2022, so I still consider myself to have less than a year of experience), I need to focus on releasing a full game which I'm truly proud of. That's why I'm currently working on a project I'm calling STANAG (named so after the NATO-grade magazines - ironic, considering reloading isn't part of the game LMAO), a roguelike which has become something I'm extremely excited to create. It's already become the best project I've made (and by a large margin, too), and I look forward to seeing what it evolves into in the future.

Computer science is something I'm extremely passionate about, and I feel it's largely thanks to ADHD. The incredible opportunities hidden within a desktop can enthrall me and keep my brain engaged, stimulated, and focused, all for times which I've never found anything else competitive with. The opportunity to not only enjoy something which I can love without hyperfixation, but also be able to pursue a career in it, is one I'm naught to pass up. 

If I've got one goal for my career in compsci, and life in general, it would be to help people who've gone through similar things that I have. Games like Terraria, Dark Souls, and Titanfall 2 have all helped me through some extremely dark times, and if I can help even one person the way any one of those games helped me, I'd be happy with that.

I use the Unity game engine with a modified version of the C# language. I'm currently learning the Big 3 of Web Design, JS, CSS, and HTML, as well as continuously trying to improve my Unity skills. Right now I'm focusing more on learning game design than on learning code, because I've realized with the founding of a new major project that I can't just BS my way through content like I did for game jams - I have to actually plan, conceptualize, and not just make a game, but make a *fun* game.

I use Aseprite for pixel art, Visual Studio Code for my code editor, and I steal I mean pirate I mean source all my sounds from online copyright-free libraries.

I'm on Discord @Carnoraptor2048!
