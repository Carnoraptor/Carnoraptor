# Hey!
## I'm Carnoraptor - I love all things computer science, but my main passions lie in game development and theory

I'm currently developing a game I'm calling CHAOS MAGNUM. Once I'm satisfied with a demo, I'll go public with it, but for now, it's just limited to this out-of-the-way GitHub page.

I'm in the process of switching my game to Godot from Unity in response to the recent pricing changes. I'm fluent in C# and JavaScript, and semi-fluent in Java.

I use Aseprite for pixel art, Visual Studio Code for my code editor, and I steal I mean pirate I mean source all my sounds from online copyright-free libraries.

I'm on Discord @Carnoraptor2048!
