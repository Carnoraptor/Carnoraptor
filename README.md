Yo, Iâ€™m @Carnoraptor

I aspire to be a game developer using the Unity engine. I'm currently working on a project with the working title 'Chicken with a Gun'. Hopefully this project will be
created fairly soon! 

I use the following software:
Blender for 3D modeling
Aesprite for 2D pixel art
Unity as a game engine
Corel Paintshop for graphic design
Visual Studio to code
